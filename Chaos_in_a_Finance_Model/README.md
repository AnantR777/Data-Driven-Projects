Chaos in a Finance Model

We describe how to derive a dynamic model of finance composed of the sub-blocks production, money, stock and labour force. The finance system model describes the evolution of x (the interest rate), y (the investment demand) and z (the price index).
- Note that factors that affect x are surplus between investment and savings and structural adjustment from prices (adjusts the country's economicÂ structure).
- The rate of change of y should be proportional to the rate of investment and inversely proportional to the cost of investment and interest rates.
- Changes in z are affected by the difference between supply and demand in commercial markets and are also affected by interest rates.

Derivation:
- We represent the surplus between investment and savings as $y - a$ where a is the savings amount. x is also affected by z since it's it's affected by the prices of goods. We can therefore illustrate the rate of change of savings as $$\dot x= (y-a)x + z$$
- Since the rate of change of y is inversely proportional to cost of investment this gives $-by$ term and it's highly impacted by interest rates (which it's also inversely proportional to) giving $-x^2$ term. We can therefore illustrate the rate of change of investment demand as $$\dot y = 1-by-x^2$$
	where b is the cost per investment
- Finally the rate of change of z depends on the current interest rate (which if very high will increase and if very low will decrease) so it is inversely proportional to x, and it also varies inversely with the current price for similar reasons. We therefore can illustrate the rate of change of prices as $$\dot z = -x-cz$$
	where c is the elasticity of demand
