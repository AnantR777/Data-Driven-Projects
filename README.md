Electricty Demand Prediction - forecasting electricity demand in the UK using random forest regression
  - Built a predictive model for electricity demand in Great Britain, using scikit-learn to implement random forest regression
  - Prepared and analysed historical time-series data using pandas, incorporating relevant variables affecting the demand
  - Engineered impactful features, tuned hyperparameters and trained and tested the model, achieving 90% accuracy
